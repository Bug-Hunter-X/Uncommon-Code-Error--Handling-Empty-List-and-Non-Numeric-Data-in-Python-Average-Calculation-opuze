This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Python: improper handling of empty lists and non-numeric input in a function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The `bug.py` file shows the initial flawed code, resulting in either a `ZeroDivisionError` or a `TypeError`. The solution (`bugSolution.py`) provides a robust approach that gracefully handles these edge cases and prevents program crashes.
